**Fearless Leadership and Innovation: The Legacy of Ms. Joglekar at CMC Mumbai** 

by Dharmendra Naik, my 1st boss, Ms. Madam Joglekar passed away in 2023. We will miss madam forever. 

In the vibrant corridors of CMC Mumbai, Ms. Joglekar stood as a beacon of fearless leadership and unparalleled mentorship. For those fortunate enough to work under her guidance, like myself, she was more than just a boss—she was a transformative figure who left an indelible mark on our professional journeys.

Ms. Joglekar was known for her empowering approach to leadership. She believed in the potential of young engineers, nurturing their growth and instilling in them the importance of truly understanding customer requirements. With a sharp focus on addressing pain points from the customer’s perspective, she taught us the essence of empathy in business—a skill that remains invaluable.

Her coaching extended beyond technical prowess; she cultivated leaders. Through her guidance, we learned not only to navigate challenges but to thrive in them. She emphasized the qualities of good leadership, from clear communication and decision-making to fostering collaboration within the team.

Beyond mentorship, Ms. Joglekar's contributions to groundbreaking projects set her apart as a visionary. Under her leadership, the Communication Group at CMC Mumbai implemented several innovative systems that showcased her technical and managerial acumen:

1. **Ticketless Trunk Exchange System (TTE)** at Baroda Trunk Exchange.
2. **Call Validation and Efficiency Monitoring System (CVEM)** at MTNL-Mumbai.
3. **Automation of Morning Alarm and Local Assistance (AMALA)**, trialed at Kidwai Bhawan Telephone Exchange of MTNL-Delhi.
4. **Operatorless ‘2198’ System** at Prabhadevi Telephone Exchange of MTNL-Mumbai.
5. **Voice Mail for Small Office Environments**, seamlessly integrated with EPABX to connect users, mailbox owners, and outsiders.
6. **Telephone Exchange Call Simulator**, installed at Bharat Electronics Ltd., Bangalore.
7. **Remote Terminal Units**, developed for the Gas Turbine Research Centre of the Defence Establishment at Bangalore.

One project particularly close to me during my time with her was the Call Validation Efficiency Monitoring (CVEM) initiative. Her support was instrumental in the successful execution of this project. She not only provided strategic direction but also encouraged innovation and resourcefulness, ensuring that each team member felt ownership of the outcomes.

Ms. Joglekar’s fearless demeanor was contagious. Her courage to tackle complex problems head-on and her unwavering dedication to excellence set a standard that inspired all of us. She demonstrated that true leadership is about enabling others to shine and achieve their best.

Even years later, the lessons I learned from Ms. Joglekar continue to influence my professional and personal life. She remains a role model for what it means to lead with purpose, compassion, and fearlessness. Her legacy at CMC Mumbai is a testament to the profound impact a great leader can have.
